I grasp every opportunity available to me and strive to be enthusiastic and positive. What I enjoy most is being given tasks and objectives that challenge my abilities and talents.

I am studying with Makers Academy as I am passionate about technology and love to be challenged, and have found programming to be the perfect combination of the two.

I am looking for a Full Stack Developer role where I can continue to learn something new every day, in a place that loves developing great software. I would also love the opportunity to use some amazing technologies such as Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain.
