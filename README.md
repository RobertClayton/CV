I grasp every opportunity available to me and strive to be enthusiastic and positive. What I enjoy most is being given tasks and objectives that challenge my abilities and talents.

I worked as a technician for the leading global law firm, after only 10 months I was given the responsibility to run the Production department for London. I am now studying with Makers Academy as I have a passion for technology and a challenge and have found code to be the perfect combination of the two.

I'm looking for a Full Stack Junior Developer role where I can continue to learn something new every day, in an organisation that loves developing great software, with the opportunity to use some amazing technologies such as Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain.
