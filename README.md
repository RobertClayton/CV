I am a Full Stack Developer seeking a role where I can learn something new every day. I taught myself to code in my spare time enjoying it so much, that I changed career and re-trained at Makers Academy.

I am passionate about technology and love to be challenged, programming to me is the perfect combination of the two.

Before re-training I ran the London Production department for a large law firms.

# Skills

- **Communication** - Each day over the last three months, I have either been pair programming or working in an Agile team of 4-6 people.
- **Fast and Adaptable learner** - Whilst at MakersAcademy I have been challenged to both learn a new technology and build a program in that new language within a week. Please view my [Projects](#projects) above.
- **Feedback** - I enjoy and thrive off receiving feedback. I believe this is one of the strongest ways to learn and have found it incredibly useful to my development.
- **Analytical thinker / Problem Solver** - Having taken on some complex challenges, I have greatly expanded my analytical abilities. An example would be the [Blockchain](https://github.com/RobertClayton/building_a_blockchain) project above: Understanding and building this involved diagramming, planning, discussions, prototyping and testing - before the actual building of this project.
