I am looking for a Full Stack Developer role where I can continue to learn something new every day, in a place that loves developing great software. I would also love the opportunity to use some amazing technologies such as Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain.

I am studying with Makers Academy as I am passionate about technology and love to be challenged, and have found programming to be the perfect combination of the two.

Before Makers Academy I ran the production department in London for a Magic Circle law firm.
